# I am a cat

I am a cat, My masters named me is CupCup.
I only have a set of cloth, it's color is white and black,I think it so beautiful, I very love it.
I have two masters,both of them are so busy, they go out at 8:00 am, and go back at 7:00 pm every day,
because they can feed me too much cat food every day.
I don't like not fresh food, it's so bad.
I like my masters,but I don't have time to close with them.
I stayed at home was too boring,so I wanted to go out, but I couldn't, because them was faster then me.

在这句话中，"its" 是一个所有格代词，用来表示某物（在此例中是“一套衣服”）的颜色。"its" 相当于 "belonging to it"，表明颜色是属于这套衣服的属性。

而 "it's" 是 "it is" 或 "it has" 的缩写形式，用于表示 "它是" 或 "它有"。在提到颜色的上下文中，我们并不在表达“它是”或“它有”的概念，而是想要指出衣服的颜色属性，因此使用 "its" 是恰当的。
